# Embedded JS widget

Building an embedded widget using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) and [Ractive.js](http://ractivejs.org).

## Building the widget

Assuming RequireJS and bower are already installed:

```console
$ make init
$ make
```

Now you can test ``embed.min.js`` with ``examples/index.html``, alternatively you can use [simple-autoreload-server]().

```console
$ npm install simple-autoreload-server
$ autoreload
```
